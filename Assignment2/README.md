Algorithms Program #2 - Get In Line

A kindegarten teacher is preparing to take her students to lunch. She tells them to line up from shortest to tallest in front of the classroom door. She quickly notices that the enthusiastic kids have failed to line up properly.



Here's where you come in. The teacher would like to know the minimum amount of moves to get them in the right order (inversions) according to the shortest to tallest order. Your job is to write a program using merge sort to calculate this number.



Input:

The input will consist of a number N that represents the number of kids in the class. The next line will have the order the kids lined up in represented by an integer corresponding to their heights. A zero (0) will denote the end of the input.



Output:

You will print out the minimum number of moves to get the kids in the correct order.


Example Input:

5
2 4 1 3 5
